Removes ambient city sounds in the background in all districts, music coming from cars and entirely removes the Joker Ammo vending machine voice lines. Gives a more quiet feel when there's no shootouts going on around. You can hear players opening doors, climbing ladders, switching weapons/shoulders, cooking grenades, etc better with this.



Installation:

1. Navigate to your main APB directory. If you're a Steam user, it should look something like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\APB Reloaded

2. Copy and paste the "APBGame" folder into your main APB directory where your own "APBGame" folder is and replace everything. Windows will automatically only detect the conflicting files, everything else will remain untouched.

(Skip step 3 if you've already done it.)
3. Create a shortcut of APB / APB.exe from the APB Reloaded\Binaries folder to your desktop (or wherever you launch your games from) and always start the game from there.


Note: If you launch it from the Steam Library or the GamersFirst launcher, the game will replace the custom files with the default ones and you will have to redo the entire process. Always launch the game from that newly made APB shortcut unless there is a game patch, in which case you must patch the game the normal way then re-apply the config files and launch from the shortcut again.
